🖥️ **Web UI V2 — A ChatGPT-style interface for OpenClaw**

Hey! I've been working on a redesign of the OpenClaw web UI as a personal project. It's a modern, chat-first interface that runs alongside V1 at `/v2/chat` — the existing UI is completely untouched.

**What it adds:**
• Multi-chat sidebar with search (Cmd+K), pin & archive
• Projects — group chats + file attachments into color-coded workspaces
• Live model switching & per-session skill toggles
• Edit/regenerate any message, slash command autocomplete
• Voice I/O (speech-to-text + TTS read-aloud)
• Light/dark theme toggle

All gateway changes are backward-compatible — V1 doesn't break. This is my first open-source contribution, so any feedback on the approach is very welcome!
